 *
 * options controlling copy_file() when the file already exists:
 * - none = Report an error (default behavior)
 * - skip_existing = Keep the existing file, without reporting an error.
 * - overwrite_existing = Replace the existing file
 * - update_existing = Replace the existing file only if it is older than the file being
 *   copied
 *
 * options controlling the effects of copy() on subdirectories:
 * - none = Skip subdirectories (default behavior)
 * - recursive = Recursively copy subdirectories and their content
 *
 * options controlling the effects of copy() on symbolic links:
 * - none = Follow symlinks (default behavior)
 * - copy_symlinks = Copy symlinks as symlinks, not as the files they point to
 * - skip_symlinks = Ignore symlinks
 *
 * options controlling the kind of copying copy() does:
 * - none = Copy file content (default behavior)
 * - directories_only = Copy the directory structure, but do not copy any non-directory
 *   files
 * - create_symlinks = Instead of creating copies of files, create symlinks pointing to
 *   the originals. Note: the source path must be an absolute path unless the destination
 *   path is in the current directory.
 * - create_hard_links = Instead of creating copies of files, create hardlinks that
 *   resolve to the same files as the originals
