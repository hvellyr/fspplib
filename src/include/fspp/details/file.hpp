/*! A representation to read from and write to real files
 *
 * While eyestep::filesystem::path represents the abstraction for a file or
 * directory pathname instances of this class are used to access the content of
 * a file.  std::iostream%s are unluckily very restricted (they can't be copied
 * or moved for instance), where this class comes in.  It implements a handle
 * interface to an std::iostream, and therefore can be copied and passed.
 * Reading and writing is done though always in terms of the std::iostream
 * system.
 *
 * @code
 * auto f = File("mfile.txt");
 * auto& is = f.open(std::ios::in | std::ios::binary);
 *
 * for (std::string line; std::getline(is, line); ) {
 *   sum += std::stoi(line);
 * }
 * f.close();
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see with_stream(), with_stream_for_reading(), and with_stream_for_writing() for an
 *      exception safe way of opening and closing files.
 *
 * @see eyestep::filesystem::directory_iterator for reading directory entries.
